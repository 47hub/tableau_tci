# Getting and Filtering
---
In most cases, the first thing to do when you want to automate a process is to retrieve an item/list of items based on some set of conditions. Both the REST API and TSC allow you to filter and paginate results. This module highlights some of the options available, and how combining TSC.Pager() with native Python filtering can be your superpower!
