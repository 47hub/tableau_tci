# Looping through API/TSC actions
---
In the real world, you will often need to perform the same or similar actions on multiple items at once -- using data that was sourced from somewhere else. In this module, we'll look at a simple, real-world example: You've been given a file with a list of extracts that need to be refreshed right away. We'll break this into the following actions:

---

#### 1. Reading the contents of a CSV into a Python list
#### 2. Looping through the list
#### 3. Determining the proper endpoint/method based on the type of item
#### 4. Sending the appropriate call/Calling the right method
#### 5. Understanding the responses we receive
#### 6. Querying the status of a refresh job
